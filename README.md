# Low Latency FIX TCP Server Simulator

## Overview

FIXT is an open source project that provides a server for sending orders to TCP exchanges by simulating Order Entry Point Sessions. 
It is designed to simplify the process of interacting with Order Entry Points and provides a range of features to make it 
easier to manage orders and monitor trading activity. 
With FIXT, users can easily send and track orders, manage multiple sessions, 
and automate trading strategies. This project is aimed at developers and traders who need a 
reliable and efficient way to send orders to exchanges.

## Build
To build FIXT, you will need to install the following dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can build FIXT by following these steps:

- Clone the repository: 

```
git clone 
```
